# S3.Install CMake-3.29.0 on Jetson

"The pre-installed CMake version in Jetpack is too low. We need to upgrade the CMake version in order to compile and install LMDeploy."

"To avoid the 'butterfly effect' caused by changes in the CMake version, this tutorial adopts a method that does not install the higher version of CMake into the system directory. Instead, it temporarily selects the higher version of CMake using the `export` environment variable when needed."

Download cmake-3.29.0-rc1:

```sh
cd ~
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.29.0-rc1/cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Unzip the install package:

```sh
tar xf cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Delete the install package:

```sh
rm cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Rename the folder:

```sh
mv cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64 cmake-3.29.0
cd cmake-3.29.0
mv cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64/* .
rm -rf cmake-3.29.0-rc1-linux-aarch64
```

Verify if it can run normally:

```sh
./bin/cmake --version
```

Temporarily specify CMake version as 3.29.0:

```sh
export PATH=/home/nvidia/cmake-3.29.0/bin:$PATH
```

**Note**: Please replace `nvidia` in the above command with your username.

Check if the version has changed to 3.29.0:

```sh
cmake --version
```

**Note**: The higher version of CMake only takes effect in the current terminal session. You need to re-run `export` when opening a new terminal to use the higher version of CMake.
